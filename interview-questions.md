# UNIT 2 ASSESSMENT: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: the parameter is the placeholder for the value you are wanting to pass in a function. the argument is the actual value when the function is called. 

Researched answer: i feel as if my answer is close above. when i research i see the paramet is a variable in a function definition. arguments are the concrete values or variable that supplied to the functions parameters for when the function is called. so i do feel like i get that accross in my answer.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: a class is the blueprint for objects. classes are defined by using class and then pascal case. objects can be created using {}. 

Researched answer: although what i have above is correct its not really enough. while researching i have found some other differences in more technical terms. one that stood out is that classes encapsulate properties and methods while objects hold specific data and can have properties and methods. also for classes you are able to create an instance using new keyword. classes support inheritance and object do not support this. classes are used to create multiple objects. objects are there own set of data and methods.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: reapeating an action over and over until the condition is met.

Researched answer: my answer is general and correct but to get technical. and i liked this. its like a set of instruction to process data, perform a task until a certain condition is met. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Answer: its the default behavior of moving variable declarations to the top of their containing scope.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

1. React State: a data structure used to store data within a React component.

2. React Props: a specialized React object that are used to pass information from one component to another. 

3. DOM events: interactions depended on what the user is doing on the page. DOM events can be something as simple as scrolling on the page or clicking on the page.
